# Assignment Title: Hands-on Exercise: Creating a Responsive Webpage with a Flexible Layout

## Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to provide students with practical experience in designing and developing a responsive webpage that adapts to various screen sizes. Students will learn to create a flexible layout using HTML, CSS, and media queries.

## Assignment Overview:
In this hands-on exercise, students will design and develop a responsive webpage that effectively adjusts its layout based on the user's device (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile). The webpage should include a header, a navigation bar, a content section, a sidebar, and a footer. The layout should be flexible and rearrange itself to optimize usability across different screen sizes.

## Requirements:

### Structure:

Header: Contains the title of the webpage and a logo.
Navigation Bar: Includes links to at least four different sections/pages. The navigation should be user-friendly on all devices.
Main Content Area: A section that displays the main content. This can be a blog post, article, or any other content of your choice.
Sidebar: A sidebar that contains additional links, a search bar, or any other relevant information.
Footer: Includes copyright information, social media links, and contact details.

### Design:
Use a flexible grid system or Flexbox for the layout.
Apply CSS media queries to make the webpage responsive.
Ensure the layout adjusts smoothly when the screen size changes.
The navigation bar should convert into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
The sidebar can either collapse or move below the main content on mobile devices.
Use appropriate margins, padding, and typography to enhance readability and aesthetics.

### Content:

You are free to choose the content for the webpage, but it should be relevant to the telemedicine application.

### Responsive Behavior:

The webpage should be fully functional and visually appealing on screens of different sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).
Test the layout on at least three different screen sizes: large (desktop), medium (tablet), and small (mobile).
